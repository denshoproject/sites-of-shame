WRA,War Relocation Authority,"The War Relocation Authority was formed by executive order on March 18, 1942 and was charged with the custody of the 110,000 Japanese Americans forcibly removed from the West Coast by military order. Its main solution was to build ten American style concentration camps—which it called “relocation centers”—that were located throughout the western United States and Arkansas. While these camps were being built, most of the excluded Japanese Americans were sent first to temporary detention sites euphemistically called “assembly centers” that were run by the army’s Wartime Civil Control Administration. Japanese Americans in the WRA’s orbit were also held in various other types of confinement sites, some run by the WRA, some by other agencies.",https://encyclopedia.densho.org/War_Relocation_Authority/
EAIS,EAIS,"Based on years of surveillance of Japanese American communities across the country and in Hawai’i, the FBI and local law enforcement began arresting “enemy aliens” after the attack on Pearl Harbor, with 736 Issei (along with some German and Italian aliens) in custody by the end of the day. The numbers swelled to 5,500 in subsequent months. The vast majority were male immigrant community leaders—Buddhist priests, Japanese language school teachers, leaders of immigrant organizations—though there were also a few women. Internees were often held in local jails or prisons initially before being moved to immigration detention stations run by the INS, then to internment camps run by the Justice Department or the army. Unlike those held by the WRA, internees held by the Justice Department were given individual hearings, though these hearings were strongly biased against the internees. On the basis of these hearings, some were released or paroled, though that generally meant incarceration in WRA camps, where at least they could rejoin their families. Others were interned for the duration of the war.",https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Custodial_detention_/_A-B-C_list/
Hawaii,Hawaii,"Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, martial law was declared in the Territory of Hawai’i and would remain in force for nearly three years. While the military government opted against mass incarceration of local Japanese Americans, it did set up a system of selective detention that eventually imprisoned over 2,000 Nikkei, as well as a much smaller number of local German and Italian Americans. While the vast majority were Issei men, there was a significant number of Nisei and a handful of women as well. The military government set up a series of mostly short-term detention sites on the various islands and established the Sand Island site in Honolulu Harbor as a clearinghouse site. Most of the Issei were eventually transferred to internment camps in the continental US in 1942, and many immediate family members of these men later followed them. Remaining detainees—who were mostly Nisei—were transferred to Honouliuli, a newly built camp in central O’ahu when Sand Island closed in March 1943.",https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Martial_law_in_Hawaii/
Concentration Camp,Concentration Camp,"The ten main WRA camps—which most now rightly refer to as American “concentration camps”—held some 120,000 Japanese Americans in total (including nearly 6,000 who were born in those camps and other later arrivals) and were built in desolate locations, surrounded by barbed wire, and guarded by armed sentries in towers. Japanese Americans were herded into these camps beginning in the spring of 1942—though most arrived in the fall—with all but one of the camps shutting down by the end of 1945.",
Temporary Assembly Center,Temporary Assembly Center,"The “assembly centers” were short-term detention facilities that held Japanese Americans in the spring and summer of 1942 while the WRA concentration camps were being built. Most adapted existing facilities—fairgrounds, migrant labor camps, even a livestock pavilion—and most were located in areas near Japanese American populations. In some of these camps—most notably Santa Anita and Tanforan, built on the site of horse racing tracks—many Japanese American inmates were forced to live in converted stables. Japanese Americans moved to the WRA camps through the summer and fall in 1942 after having spent anywhere from one to six months in “assembly centers.”  There were fifteen dedicated “assembly centers” as well as two newly built “reception centers” that later became the Manzanar and Poston WRA camps. There were also two additional “assembly centers” that were prepared but never actually used by the WCCA, the army agency that ran them.",https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Assembly_centers/
Additional Facility,Additional Facility,"In addition to the ten main camps, there were a number of other sites in the WRA orbit, some run by the WRA, some run in cooperation with it. These included everything from tuberculosis sanitaria in California for Japanese American patients too sick to travel to concentration camps to a camp briefly established to segregate Manzanar inmates targeted by dissidents for their own protection.",
Citizen Isolation Center,Citizen Isolation Center,"The WRA also ran a series of three prison camps in 1942–43 for inmates it considered recalcitrant. WRA officials were able to designate inmates for these separate detention facilities at their whim, and once confined, these inmates had no recourse. When the final isolation center closed at the end of 1943, inmates there were transferred to the Tule Lake Segregation Center.",https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Moab/Leupp_Isolation_Centers_(detention_facility)/
Department of Justice Internment Camp,Department of Justice Internment Camp,"Longer term enemy alien internment camps operated by the Department of Justice. The largest of these camps—Santa Fe (New Mexico), Fort Lincoln (North Dakota), and Fort Missoula (Montana)—each held about 1,000 Issei men in early to mid 1942. After their hearings, these men were subsequently sent to “assembly centers” or WRA concentration camps or to army-run detention camps by the end of 1943. Each of these camps held a second group of Nikkei internees later in the war. There were also more specialized camps that held women (Seagoville), families (Crystal City) and “voluntary” laborers (Kooskia). Some of these camps also held Japanese Latin Americans as well as German and Italian nationals.",
Immigration Detention Station,Immigration Detention Station,"Short term enemy alien detention sites located in existing immigration detention facilities such as Ellis Island (New York) or San Francisco or facilities quickly adapted from CCC camps or other such facilities, such as Tuna Canyon (California). Sites located in areas with large Japanese American populations held hundreds of Issei, while sites away from the West Coast held only a few. After a period ranging from a few days to months, internees were transferred to longer term internment camps run by the Department of JusticeU.S. Army detention camps held Issei from mid-1942 to mid-1943. Those mainland Issei whose hearings resulted in a ruling interning them for the duration of the war transferred to army camps from Justice Department internment camps in mid-1942. Issei transferred from Hawai’i throughout 1942 also were held in army camps such as Fort Sill (Oklahoma) or Camp Forrest (Tennessee). Lordsburg (New Mexico) held by far the largest number of Issei, with a peak population of around 1,500. A number of the army internment camps were attached to troop training facilities and a number of camps—Camp McCoy (Wisconsin), Fort Bliss (Texas) among them—served as training facilities for some Nisei soldiers as well. With increasing numbers of POWs needing detention space, the army and Justice Department jointly decided to move internees from the former to the latter starting in May 1943. The army detention camps subsequently became POW camps.",

U.S. Federal Prison,US Federal Prison,Three federal prisons also became part of the WRA orbit when draft resisters from the WRA camps were held there. These prisons ranged from the relatively relaxed setting of a mountain work camp in Arizona to a maximum security prison in Kansas.,https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Draft_resistance/

Location Before and After Camp,Location Before and After Camp,"The incarceration and exclusion devastated Japanese American communities across the West Coast. Many individuals in the WRA system left camp for areas outside of the exclusion zone even when it became legally permitted later in the war because of fears of discrimination and, in some cases, physical violence. While most eventually migrated back to the west coast states by the 1950s, many of the communities they left behind never recovered.",
From Assembly Centers to Camps,From Assembly Centers to Camps,"In the initial period following the citizen exclusion orders, the permanent detention facilities were still under construction. Tens of thousands of individuals were detained in temporary assembly centers for weeks and sometimes months before traveling by trains or buses to the ten WRA concentration camps. ",
Yasui,Yasui Family,"From Hood River, Oregon, where patriarch Masuo was a successful businessman and issei community leader who was interned. One son, Minoru, challenged the constitutionality of the curfew and exclusion in a case that went to the U.S. Supreme Court. Most of the rest of the family went to Portland Assembly Center and Tule Lake and throughout the country after leaving camp. Several of the Yasuis became prominent after the war and two documentary films have been made about the family including Lise Yasui's Academy Award nominated, Family Gathering.",
Yasutake,Yasutake Family,"The Yasutakes lived in Seattle prior to the war, where patriarch Jack Kaichiro Yasutake worked for the Immigration and Naturalization Service as an interpreter. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he was nonetheless arrested and interned—he was first imprisoned in the same INS facility in which he had worked for some twenty years—and sent to the Missoula, Montana, internment camp later in December. Matriarch Hide Shiraki Yasutake and their four children aged ten to twenty-one were subsequently sent to the Puyallup Assembly Center in May 1942, then to the Minidoka, Idaho, concentration camp after around four months. Eldest son Seiichi Michael and only daughter Mitsuye May left Minidoka in May of 1943 to pursue further education in Cincinnati, Ohio, while second son Toshio volunteered for the army, eventually becoming a medic for the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. Hide and youngest son Yoshiyuki Joe were eventually able to reunite with Jack at the Crystal City, Texas, family internment camp in March of 1944. They joined Michael and Mitsuye in Cincinnati upon their release.",
Nishimura,Nishimura Family,"The Nishumuras were an older Issei/Nisei family based in Kent, Washington before the war, most of whom went to Pinedale, Tule Lake, and Minidoka. The five surviving Nisei siblings ranged in age from twenty-one to thirty-two and were all married or divorced. While eldest son Hank and his wife opted for “voluntary evacuation” in eastern Washington, the other siblings each went to camp with their families, and all left early for various destinations in the Midwest or Mountain states. Eldest daughter Peggie had two teen-age children who were old enough to resettle on their own, and she eventually left Minidoka to join them in Chicago. Issei parents Kumataro and Kaju stayed in Minidoka until nearly the end before joining Hank and his family in Wenatchee, Washington.",
Umemoto,Umemoto Family,"A farming family in Florin, California, before the war, the Umemotos were permanently divided by the war. Matriarch Kusu ran the farm with the aid of adult sons Ben and Sam as well as three younger children, Miharu, Yoshimi, and Hank. In the spring of 1942, various family members went to three sets of camps: Manzanar, Tanforan/Topaz, and Merced/Amache. After segregation, Ben, Sam, and Miharu and their families end up at the Tule Lake Segregation Center, and Ben and Sam and their families are among the Tule Lake inmates who end up being deported to Japan at war’s end. Miharu and her family remain in the U.S. and leave Tule Lake for Seabrook Farms, New Jersey. Kusu, Yoshimi, and Hank remain in Manzanar until war’s end and move to Los Angeles. While Sam and his wife eventually moved back to the U.S. in the 1950s, Ben and his family remained in Japan, and Ben and his wife Annie never set foot in the U.S. again.",
Hoshida,Hoshida Family,"George Hoshida was a salesman and artist in Hilo, Hawaii when he was arrested in February 1942 and taken to a succession of camps. His wife and three daughters—one a newborn—were sent to Jerome in December 1942; he eventually joined them there in December 1943. Their eldest daughter, Taeko, who had been severely disabled in a car accident had to be left behind and died while they were interned on the mainland. When Jerome closed in June 1944, the family moved to Gila River, from which they returned to Hawai’i in December 1945. George’s drawing and paintings provide a rare internee-centered view of the various detention camps he was held in.",
Exclusion Orders,Exclusion Orders,"A series of orders issued by Gen. John L. DeWitt as head of the Western Defense Command (WDC) directing the exclusion of ""all persons of Japanese ancestry, including aliens and non-aliens"" from designated areas on the West Coast.",

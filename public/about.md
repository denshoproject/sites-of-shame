# Sites of Shame

During World War II, more than 125,000 individuals of Japanese ancestry living in the continental U.S. or Hawai`i were held without trial in a complex network of detention sites throughout the U.S. Over half of those imprisoned were U.S. citizens. Over 2,000 Japanese Latin Americans were also involuntarily brought to the U.S. and held in detention camps.

Forty years later, the U.S. government determined that the incarceration was wrong and President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. While many of the physical sites have faded into the landscape, their history serves as a reminder of the fragility of our democracy.

## About the Project

**Sites of Shame** first launched in 2005 and immediately became one of the most visited sections of Densho's website. But after a decade or so, due to both changes in the technology and new information about the sites, it became clear that the original website had become increasingly outdated. In 2017, Densho received a federal Japanese American Confinement Sites grant through the National Park Service to update the site. This was followed by grants from California Civil Liberties Public Education Program and the Kip Tokuda Memorial Washington Civil Liberties Public Education Program. This new version of **Sites of Shame** launched in 2021.

## About the Data

The location data for the project was created using a variety of geodata mapping tools. Many of the sites no longer exist or have changed substantially since the incarceration period, so extensive research was required. Using a combination of satellite imagery and archival materials -- including government documents  and historical photographs -- Densho staff attempted to precisely locate each facility. 

Producing geodata for the exclusion orders was also challenging. The orders themselves consisted of hastily-constructed, hand-drawn maps, accompanied by a textual description of the affected areas. The landscapes of urban cities like Los Angeles were radically transformed in the post-WWII period so some of the streets denoted in the orders have disappeared or been renamed. Densho staff painstakingly researched, then reconstructed the boundaries of each order with mapping software. 

Most of the statistical data used to create this site comes from official sources. The infamous _Final Report, Japanese Evacuation from the West Coast, 1942_ was issued under the name of Western Defense Command Head General John L. DeWitt in January 1944. Though perhaps remembered today mostly for including information on the rationale for the mass exclusion of Japanese Americans from the West Coast that the government knew to be false at the time, the report also included detailed statistics on various aspects of that exclusion. Information on the number of Japanese Americans affected by each of the 108 "exclusion orders" comes from Table 47 (page 363–66), while information on the shipments of Japanese Americans from the "assembly centers" to the War Relocation Authority (WRA) administered "relocation centers" comes from Table 33 (page 282–84). The images of the exclusion orders themselves comes from the collection of the Japanese American Evacuation and Resettlement Study held at the Bancroft Library at the University of California at Berkeley; they can be downloaded at <a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/ark:/28722/bk0014b1k1d/?brand=oac4" target="_blank">https://oac.cdlib.org/ark:/28722/bk0014b1k1d/?brand=oac4</a> and <a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/ark:/28722/bk0014b1k2z/?brand=oac4" target="_blank">https://oac.cdlib.org/ark:/28722/bk0014b1k2z/?brand=oac4</a>.
 
Statistical information on the comings and goings of Japanese Americans to and from the WRA concentration camps comes from information in Densho's Names Registry, which in turn comes from two large caches of WRA data, the Form WRA-26 register and the Final Accountability Rosters. See the  <a href="https://ddr.densho.org/names/" target="_blank">Names Registry homepage</a>, for more information on these sources. Additional information came from the WRA’s statistical summary, _The Evacuated People: A Quantitative Description_, originally published in 1946.

## Licensing and Use

Densho hopes that the research conducted by **Sites of Shame** will contribute to future scholarship and overall knowledge about the incarceration period. We would like to see the data used by others in novel ways that promote awareness of the Japanese American experience in the context of the history of the United States.

During World War II, more than 125,000 individuals of Japanese ancestry
were held without trial in a complex network of detention sites
throughout the U.S. Over two-thirds of those imprisoned were U.S.
citizens.

Forty years later, the U.S. government determined that the incarceration
was wrong and President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. While many of the physical sites have faded into the landscape,
their history serves as a reminder of the fragility of our democracy.

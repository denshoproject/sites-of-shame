The second least populous of the WRA camps (to Amache), Topaz had a peak population of 8,130 inmates. Topaz had one of the most urban and most homogeneous populations with nearly its entire inmate population coming from the San Francisco Bay Area. Topaz is perhaps best known as the site of the fatal shooting of an inmate by an overzealous camp sentry in April 1943 and for its art school, which included a faculty roster of notable Issei and Nisei artists. It was also the site of significant protest against registration in the spring of 1943 and of a variety of labor disputes. The Topaz Museum, which opened to the public in 2015, is located in nearby Delta, Utah and today owns much of the land on which the camp had once been built.
","Located at 4,600 feet of elevation in west-central Utah, Topaz was set in Millard County near the town of Delta, 140 miles southwest of Salt Lake City. Topaz Mountain was 9 miles northwest.

The largest and most populous of the War Relocation Authority (WRA) administered concentration camps (with the exception of post-segregation Tule Lake) with a peak population of nearly 18,000, Poston was unique among WRA camps in a number of ways. First, it was jointly managed by the Office of Indian Affairs (OIA), an arrangement that was troubled and that ended with the OIA withdrawing by the beginning of 1944. Secondly, it was divided into three separate camps arranged in a line about three miles apart. It likely had the most rural population, its inmates hailing mostly from farming areas of southern, central and coastal California. Finally, about 2/3 of its population came directly to Poston without going to an assembly center first, something that set it apart from all other WRA camps with the exception of Manzanar. Poston's Unit I was also the site of a fall 1942 mass strike that was one of two well publicized blow-ups on WRA camps that influenced WRA policies in the years to come.

Gila had perhaps the most extensive agricultural program of any of the WRA camps; in addition to supplying all of the vegetables consumed at the camp during peak production periods, Gila also supplied 20% of the produce consumed at other WRA camps as well.

Thus, essentially all of Manzanar's 10,000 inmates went directly to Manzanar without passing through another ""assembly center.""
